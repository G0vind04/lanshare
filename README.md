# LanSher 🦁⚡ 

**LanSher** combines **LAN** (networking) with **Sher** (lion in Hindi), symbolizing **strength, speed, and dominance** in LAN data transfer.

## Motivation
LanSher was born during a hackathon when sharing text and code through WhatsApp and online clipboards felt inefficient. Remembering our college lessons, we explored Python sockets—and what started as a quick fix soon became a powerful peer-to-peer transfer tool.

## Key Features
- ⚡ **Fast Transfers** – Direct, high-speed data sharing without external servers.
- 🔒 **Secure & Private** – No internet dependency, ensuring local-only transfers.
- 📂 **File & Text Sharing** – Send files or text messages instantly between connected devices.
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform** – Works on multiple operating systems within a LAN environment. Tried and Tested in Windows (only).
- 🖱️ **Drag & Drop Support** – Quickly share text with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application
To start the application, run:
```bash
python retro_transfer.py
```

## How to Use
1. Launch the application.
2. Click on "Refresh Peers" to view your IP address.
3. Enter the receiver's IP address and the Port as "12345".
4. Enter the text to send into the clipboard or browse the files to send.
5. Select a peer from the list and click "Send File".
6. The file will be transferred instantly.
